<p>Mothman is a folklore known around the country based in Point Pleasant, West Virgian. He is rumored to of to shown up in this small river town in 1960's where he was apperently seen chasing couples, learing on tree tops and causing a bridge collapes. I choose this topic because I have always had a love for cryptids and have been to the Mothman museum in Point Pleasant.</p>
